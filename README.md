# Emotion-based music player
This project utilizes human facial recognition to identify the emotions of the user and then recommend them a song that matches using a music emotion classification algorithm trained with Spotify data gathered from the API.

We utilize a CNN neural network to build the facial emotion recognition model and k-nearest neighbors classification to build the music emotion classification model.
